## Concept

### Issues / Problems
<!--

The general format is an adaptation of the ideas developed in Alexander's _et al_ [A Patttern Language]( https://books.google.com/books?id=hwAHmktpk5IC&pg=PR10#v=onepage&q&f=false ) - as sammarized on page 10.

Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice.

patterns are descriptions of common problems and proposal for the solutions that can be used repeatedly every time the problem is encountered and producing an different outcome.

Seeing Astronomy in Many Ways

* From Earth, we 'see' the Moon as a flat static one-sided disk. Yet we know it is a 3D orb with a surface full of complexity and changes.



### Mission
<!-- a statement of a rationale, applicable now as well as in the future -->

* To provide simple code that flies over the Moon in 3D and to see its craters and rills in detail
* To display the usually hidden backside of the moon as easily as the front side


### Vision
<!--  a descriptive picture of a desired future state -->

* To build a platform that enables all sorts of moon data - gravity, minerals, magnetism, etc - to be displayed in 3D

# Apps

_Descriptions and links to the scripts developed so far._

## Moon Voyager

* The Moon as a 3D sphere
	* You can rotate, zoom and move the sphere
* 1440 x 720 data points
* Displays placards with the names of 97 important Moon locations according to the-moon.wikispaces.com
* Six apps based on a common core
	* Each app handles Three.js material in a different way
	* Each adds fun feature demos

## Moon Rover Mobile

* The Moon as a flat map - with elevations in 3D
* Intended to be the lightest, fastest loading version of the flat map
	* But with the least detail

## Moon Rover 64P

* 64 pixels per degree
* Good for touring the entire moon quite quickly
* This version was an early version in the current project
	* Will be updated in due course
	* Moon Rover 256P is a better tool for the moment

## Moon Rover 256P

* 256 pixels per degree ~4.25 billion points of data
* Great detail views of the moon

## Moon Gazetteer

* Text files with lunar place names, location and other data
* Utilities for dealing with these files

[Moon Gazetteer Read Me - Source Code]( https://github.com/jaanga/moon/tree/gh-pages/gazetteer/ )  

## Moon Utilities

* Node.js scripts for reading binary IMG heightmap files, creating PNG files and saving these to disk
* Scripts for viewing and testing the files

## Moon Heightmaps

_Perhaps the most important aspect of this project_

* Heightmaps for the Moon in a variety of sizes and formats
* Over two gigabytes of heightmap data simply and freely accessible via GitHub
* Data contained in four repositories

## Things to Do

### Current Mission
* Begin to think of more topics to be added
	* Ideas and sources for image overlays / textures for 3D surfaces such as gravity, geology, magnetism

### Code
* Direct links to demos??
* More carousel examples

### User Experience
* Add more links
	* Add curator comments to links
* Add to and enhance comments
