## Concept

### Issue

From earth, we 'see' the moon as a flat one-sided disk. Yet we know it is a 3D orb with a surface full of complexity.

### Mission
<!-- a statement of a rationale, applicable now as well as in the future -->

* To provide a way of flying over the Moon in 3D and to see its craters and rills in detail
* To show the usually hidden backside of the moon as easily as the front side

### Vision
<!--  a descriptive picture of a desired future state -->

* To help you make some new discoveries about the Moon

# Apps
