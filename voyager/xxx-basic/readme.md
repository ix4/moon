## Concept

### Issue


### Mission

* The first and most basic of the Voyager series
	* A good file to start with when you want to build your own app
* Named 'Gamer' because of the exaggerated colors and heights


## Things to Do

* Edit the auto rotation variable to change the speed of the spin of the moon
* Edit heighPlacard to move the location signboards up or down
* Edit the default height scale


## Features

* 1440 x 720 terrain data points with 255 heights
* 'Travel' over the moon in 3D faster than any satellite
	* Use one finger to rotate
	* Pinch with two fingers to zoom in and out
	* use three fingers to pan
* Gazetteer takes you to 97 locations
	* All locations available via a drop-down list
	* Clicking a location in the drop-down takes you to the location

* Slider to adjust vertical scale in real-time
* Camera position follows cursor keys
	* Latest camera position is used to control camera position when using cursor keys 


## Issues

* Text flashes annoyingly as it moves
