## Concept

### Issue

There are may existing, quite beautiful 2D Mercator projection maps of the Moon. 
Is it possible to drape or overlay these images over a 3D terrain and have attractive results  

## Mission

To provide a way of flying over the sphere of the moon in 3D and to see its craters and rills in detail
To show the usually hidden backside of the moon as easily as the front


## Things to Do

* Ensure that the 2D images line up as closely as possible with the 3D landscape
* Locate cool overalays



## Features

* 1440 x 720 terrain data points with 255 heights
* 'Travel' over the moon in 3D faster than any satellite
	* Use one finger to rotate
	* Pinch with two fingers to zoom in and out
	* use three fingers to pan
* Gazetteer takes you to 97 locations
	* All locations available via a drop-down list
	* Clicking a location in the drop-down takes you to the location

* Slider to adjust vertical scale in real-time
* Camera position follows cursor keys
	* Latest camera position is used to control camera position when using cursor keys

## Road Map

* 'Zoom All' and 'Zoom In' buttons
* Toggle between short and long gazetteers
* Links to Data sources such as WikiMoon for each location
* First person control moon flyover capability
* Supports permalinks
* Click on a placard to go there
* Permalinks to set target and camera positions
* Sunlight and shadows
* Textures and materials to 3D terrain
* 3D models of lunar landers in their locations
* Locations of Apollo photographs - perhaps as geojson data

## Issues

* Text flashes annoyingly as it moves
