## Concept

### Issues

'Why does the Moon have different phases?' is not an easy question to answer

### Mission

To display in real-time 3D how the moon orbits around the Earth while the Earth orbits the sun and both recive light from the Sun.

### Vision


## Features

* First camera displays Moon orbiting around the Earth which in turn is orbiting the sun
	* Sunlight on the Moon and Earth is visible
* Second camera is placed midway between Earth and Moon
	* Displays the phases of the Moon
* Simple keyboard events UI
	* Press C or spacebar to switch cameras
	* Press P to pause
	* Press 1, 2 or 3 to change speed of the orbiting
* Simulated star field

## Things to Do / Road Map

* More realistic orbits
	* Currently Earth and Moon follow highly simplified circular orbits
	* Could be to scale and follow real trajectories see [jsOrrery]( http://mgvez.github.io/jsorrery/ )
* Improve Three.js materials 
	* Texture corresponding to the actual albedo
	* Better choice of colors and shininess
	* Add textures for Earth and Sun
* Improve Three.js frames per second rate
	* Currently under 20 fps - not good
* Add different camera controllers
* Replace star field with star sphere

## Credits

The simplified orbit concept came from Chris Strom's [The Earth and the Moon in Three.js]( http://japhr.blogspot.com/2013/01/the-earth-and-moon-in-threejs.html )
