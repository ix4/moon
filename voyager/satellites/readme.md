[Moon Voyager Shaded Demo Full Screen - Dev]( http://jaanga.github.io/moon/voyager/satellites/dev/ )

## Concept

### Issue

The moon has a number of satellites - past and present. Where are they and whay do they look like?

### Mission

To display satellites orbiting the Moon in an informative manner

### Notes

This script is just to show that it is easy to add moving objects to the Voyager series of scripts.

The current satellite models - Cassini, MRO and Juno - have no actual connection with the moon.
They are fill-ins until actual models are sourced. Ditto the trajectories.


## Things to Do

* Create satellites trajectories that are elliptical and generally follow the path of the the satellite they represent
* Source models of actual satellites that orbit or have orbited the Moon
* Toggle the motion of the satellites
* Display an informative notice when a satellite is clicked



## Features

* 1440 x 720 terrain data points with 255 heights
* 'Travel' over the moon in 3D faster than any satellite
	* Use one finger to rotate
	* Pinch with two fingers to zoom in and out
	* use three fingers to pan
* Gazetteer takes you to 97 locations
	* All locations available via a drop-down list
	* Clicking a location in the drop-down takes you to the location

* Slider to adjust vertical scale in real-time
* Camera position follows cursor keys
	* Latest camera position is used to control camera position when using cursor keys 


## Road Map



## Issues

* Text flashes annoyingly as it moves
