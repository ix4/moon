## Concept

### Issue

* From earth, we 'see' the moon as a flat one-sided disk. Yet we know it is a 3D orb with a surface full of complexity.

### Mission

* To provide a way of flying over the sphere of the moon in 3D and to see its craters and rills in detail
* To show the usually hidden backside of the moon as easily as the front

### Vision

* To create depictions of the geography of that Moon that they provoke questions as to how things came to be


## Apps

### Moon Voyager Gamer

* Most basic version - uses Three.js MeshNormalMaterial

### Moon Sun Earth Moon

* Displays in real-time 3D how the Moon orbits around the Earth while the Earth orbits the Sun and both receive light from the Sun

* 1440 x 720 terrain data points with 255 heights
* 'Travel' over the moon in 3D faster than any satellite
	* Use one finger to rotate
	* Pinch with two fingers to zoom in and out
	* Use three fingers to pan
* Gazetteer takes you to 97 locations
	* All locations available via a drop-down list
	* Clicking a location in the drop-down takes you to the location

* Links to Data sources such as WikiMoon for each location
* First person control moon flyover capability
* Supports permalinks
* Click on a placard to go there
* Permalinks to set target and camera positions
* 3D models of lunar landers in their locations
* Locations of Apollo photographs - perhaps as geojson data

## Issues

* Text flashes annoyingly as it moves
