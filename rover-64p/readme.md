## Accuracy
10917 km circumference of moon / ( 360 degrees * 64 pixels per degree ) = 0.473828125 or each pixel represents 474 meters or, roughly, each pixel is about half a kilometer.

The next step up in accuracy wll be to 300+ pixels per degree or, roughly, one pixel per hundred meters.
The effort appears to be fairly trivial but requires some hours of work.
 This effort will be made as and when the time arises or whenever someone makes the request for this work to be done.
